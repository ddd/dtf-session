      <h1>Deryls Testing Framework</h1>
<h2>
  What Is DTF?
</h2>

<p>
  DTF (Deryl's Testing Framework) is designed to be a modular framework for testing everything from shell
  scripts, to Ruby, to Rails apps.  DTF acts as an umbrella skeleton which is designed to incorporate multiple
  sub-gems each of which provides additional functionality to DTF. DTF is the master skeleton within which all
  other DTF gems integrate. These additional gems conform to the naming convention: dtf-blah where 'blah' is a
  shortname for the functionality that gem provides. The 'dtf' name by itself is reserved for the Master
  Control gem alone.
</p>

<h2>
  Internal architecture
</h2>

<p>
  DTF is designed in such a way that, with the master skepeton in place, one has only to load additional
  plugins from any available DTF extension gem to add additional functionality. This can be anything ranging
  from additional languages such as Ruby, Python, C, C++, etc, to testing methods and methodologies.
</p>

<h2>
	DTF-Session Gem
</h2>

<p>
	&#39;dtf-session&#39; gem is part of the <a href="http://dtf-gems.deryldoucette.com">DTF</a> framework, and is 
	designed for Bash shell command-line based testing.
</p>

<h2>
	Installation
</h2>

<p>
	There are several ways to install, and configure the &#39;dtf-session&#39; gem.
</p>

<p>
	1) You would run 
	<pre>
		<code class="sh">
			gem install dtf-session
		</code>
	</pre>
	and once installed, run: 
	<pre>
		<code class="sh">
			rake dtf:install
		</code>
	</pre>
	to install the DTF baseline thor task(s).
</p>

<p>
	2) You would include the gem in your project&#39;s Gemfile and run:
	<pre>
		<code class="sh">
			bundle install
			rake dtf:install
		</code>
	</pre>
	to install the DTF baseline thor task(s).
</p>

<p>
	In both instances, you would continue on with the following instructions.
</p>

<p>
	DTF uses Thor for setup and configuration, and has 3 possible sub-tasks under task name &#39;dtf_setup&#39;:
</p>

<pre>
	<code class="sh">
		∴ thor list
		dtf_setup
		---------
		thor dtf_setup:config [NAME]  # Copy db configuration file(s)
		thor dtf_setup:install        # Installs database migrations, the main schema, and configuration files
	</code>
</pre>

<p>
	As you can see, you can copy just the db config files, and/or the migrations, and main schema.
</p>

<pre>
	<code class="sh">
		∴ thor help dtf_setup
		Tasks:
		  thor dtf_setup:config [NAME]  # Copy db configuration file(s)
		  thor dtf_setup:help [TASK]    # Describe available tasks or one specific task
		  thor dtf_setup:install        # Installs database migrations, the main schema, and configuration files
	</code>
</pre>

<p>
	To see how to install everything you would run the following command:
</p>

<pre>
	<code class="sh">
		∴ thor dtf_setup:help install
		Usage:
		  thor dtf_setup:install

		Options:
		  [--force]  

		Installs database migrations, the main schema, and configuration files
	</code>
</pre>

<p>
	To see how to install just the configuration files for accessing the database(s), you would run:
</p>

<pre>
	<code class="sh">
		∴ thor dtf_setup:help config
		Usage:
		  thor dtf_setup:config [NAME]

		Options:
		  [--force]  

		Copy db configuration file(s)
	</code>
</pre>

<p>
	Once the configuration files and/or database migrations are in place, the remaining setup is handled by &#39;rake&#39;.
	To see all possible commands, you would run &#39;rake -T&#39;, and pick the one(s) you need.
</p>

<pre>
	<code class="sh">
		∴ rake -T
		rake build              # Build dtf-0.2.2.gem into the pkg directory
		rake db:create          # Create the database from config/database.yml for the current Rails.env (use db:create:all to create all dbs)
		rake db:drop            # Drops the database for the current Rails.env (use db:drop:all to drop all databases)
		rake db:fixtures:load   # Load fixtures into the current environment&#39;s database.
		rake db:migrate         # Migrate the database (options: VERSION=x, VERBOSE=false).
		rake db:migrate:status  # Display status of migrations
		rake db:new_migration   # Create a new migration
		rake db:rollback        # Rolls the schema back to the previous version (specify steps w/ STEP=n).
		rake db:schema:dump     # Create a db/schema.rb file that can be portably used against any DB supported by AR
		rake db:schema:load     # Load a schema.rb file into the database
		rake db:seed            # Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb
		rake db:setup           # Create the database, load the schema, and initialize with the seed data (use db:reset to also drop the db first)
		rake db:structure:dump  # Dump the database structure to db/structure.sql. Specify another file with DB_STRUCTURE=db/my_structure.sql
		rake db:version         # Retrieves the current schema version number
		rake install            # Build and install dtf-0.2.2.gem into system gems
		rake release            # Create tag v0.2.2 and build and push dtf-0.2.2.gem to Rubygems
	</code>
</pre>

<h2>
  Usage
</h2>

<p>
  Once you have finished configuring your database(s) and applying all migrations, you are now ready to work with
  DTF directly. The following is a summary of all current possible commands, and their expected
  options/parameters:
